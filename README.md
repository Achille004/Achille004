## Introduction
### Hello Everyone!
I am Francesco Marras, an Italian programmer who is currently studying.

## Skills
- I am currently working on backend stuff (i.e. Java, Python, C++ and in future also Rust, Kotlin and C#).
- I have some good MySQL and HTML (CSS and JS included) competences.

## Future
- I am planning to create a cloud website and a little real time ray casting software.
- Considering that I enjoy messing around in Unreal Engine and Blender I'm planning to create a mini indie game.
